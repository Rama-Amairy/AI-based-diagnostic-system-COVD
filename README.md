# AI-based-diagnostic-system-COVD
Lately, I have completed a project that relies on building an efficient AI-based diagnostic system that recognizes chest X-ray images to determine whether the chest is healthy or infected with a virus or COVID.

The dataset was taken from the Kaggle competition hosted by SHAI For AI | شاي للذكاء الاصطناعي, the dataset consists of a posteroanterior (PA) view of chest X-ray images comprising Normal, Viral, and CVOID-19 affected patients. There are a total of 1709 CXR images.

I started working on a CNN model to extract features and classify images into three categories, and the result was excellent with an accuracy of 95%.

Then, I experimented with a more complex MobileNet model, which is trained and lightweight for mobile applications and relatively faster compared to models like VGG or ResNet. I have made some modifications and used appropriate hyperparameters to achieve an accuracy of 99%.

I am very happy to achieve third place in the competition.
